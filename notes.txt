You connect to the DB using mongoose which returns promises. When you have a promise you use `.then()`

You use config/default.json to store and us global variables.

Use hashing for special characters in your password - URI

Refactor to async - await for promises instead of .then .catch!!


Creating user functionality and establishing routes


Mongoose Models : You need to have a model for each resource in the database (mongoose). Inside a model theres
a schema for that specific resource.

In order to send a request body we need to use a bit of middleware. (included with express)

I want to limit the scope of what can be sent in the request body and also make sure that smth is sent.
We do this by using the express validator.

We use bcrypt to encrypt the password before storing it to the database.
